TODO list for OggConvert
------------------------

* Add a command line interface.

* Add "advanced" encoding options like cropping, resizing, fixed bitrate, etc etc.

* Add more Free codecs, i.e. Flac and Speex.

* If the input file already contains a theora/vorbis stream, copy it rather than
  reencoding (or better, ask the user what they want to do). Decodebin2 will
  make this much easier

* What about a PyQt front-end too? Or wxPython for Windows and MacOS? (Actually,
  OggConvert++ works okay on Windows, GStreamer problems excepted.)
