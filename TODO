TODO list for OggConvert
------------------------
 
* Gettext!! 
 
* Make the MediaChecker class callback based rather than blocking as a present
   
* Start using Python logging, and a command line option to change debug level

* Add the ability to specify a filename on the command line and have oggconvert 
  open with it ready to encode.

* If the input file already contains a theora/vorbis stream, copy it rather than
  reencoding (or better, ask the user what they want to do). Decodebin2 will
  make this much easier
  
* Rewrite in C so that we use about a quarter of the memory!

* Ask someone very nicely to draw a Tango-ish icon

* What about a PyQt front-end too? Or wxPython for Windows and MacOS?
