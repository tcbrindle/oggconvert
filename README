OggConvert 0.3.2
----------------

This is the latest release of OggConvert, a simple Gnome utility to convert
media files into the patent-free Theora, Dirac and Vorbis formats.

Dirac encoding requires version 1.0.0 or newer of the Schroedinger encoder for
GStreamer.

OggConvert is written in Python using PyGTK and PyGST. It is released under the 
GNU LGPL.


What's new in this version:
---------------------------

* (Hopefully) fix time remaining being way off on AMD64. Closes bug #250174.

* Fix (MPEG) files occasionally showing "120% Completed" and other such oddities.

* Dirac is no longer considered "experimental" now that the encoder has reached 
  v1.0. Go ahead and try it out!
  
* Use "perceptual weighting" in the Dirac encoder by default. This should result
  in much smaller output files (and slightly quicker encoding) at equivalent
  quality settings.
  
* OggConvert's quality settings now match ffmpeg2theora's.

* New translations: Catalan, Franco-Proven√ßal, Hebrew, Hungarian, Lithuanian, 
  Maltese, Norwegian Bokmal, Slovak, Serbian, Turkish and Traditional Chinese. 
  Many thanks to all the translators. To add your language, please go to
