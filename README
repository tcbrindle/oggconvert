OggConvert 0.1
--------------

This is the first alpha release of OggConvert, a simple Gnome utility to convert
media files into the patent-free Theora and Vorbis formats.

OggConvert is written in Python using PyGTK and PyGST. It is released under the 
GNU LGPL.



Known issues with this release:

* With GStreamer 0.10.10 (the version used in Ubuntu Edgy), transcoding from
  certain containers (Matroka and ASF in particular) will result in very choppy
  audio. This is fixed for GStreamer 0.10.11 (included in Feisty).
  
* OggConvert uses the GStreamer decodebin, so it *should* be able to convert any
  file which is playable in Totem. However, there is currently a problem with
  files which use the pitfdll/W32codecs package, whereby the pipeline doesn't
  preroll and OggConvert just hangs. I'm still investigating why this happens.
  
* OggConvert should Just Work(tm) with the Fluendo codec packages. However, I 
  don't own a copy of these plugins, so it hasn't been tested.
