OggConvert 0.3.0
----------------

This is the third major release of OggConvert, a simple Gnome utility to convert
media files into the patent-free Theora, Dirac and Vorbis formats.

Dirac encoding requires GStreamer 0.10.11 and the Schroedinger encoder. Be aware
that the encoder is still experimental, and that videos you encode today might
not be watchable in future as the decoder develops.

OggConvert is written in Python using PyGTK and PyGST. It is released under the 
GNU LGPL.


What's new in this version:
---------------------------

* Support for encoding to the Matroska container format. Thanks to Carlos 
  Perelló Marín for this.
 
* Internationalisation support, thanks to the work of Alex Kabakov.
  
* A lovely icon from A. Bram Neijt.
  
* Support for Gnome-VFS, allowing the transcoding of remote files over (for
  example) SSH or HTTP connections.
  
* A completely rewritten (and much faster) media checking routine.

* Ogg videos are now given the extension ".ogv", in line with the latest 
  Xiph.org guidelines.

* Various internal changes, hopefully for the better.

* New translations: Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, German,
  Italian, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish. Many thanks to all the
  translators. To add your language, please go to

* Other miscellaneous bug fixes.


Known issues with this release:
-------------------------------

* The video quality setting doesn't do anything for Dirac encoding, due to the
  encoder not (yet) having this option available.

* Gnome-VFS support hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. There may be bugs here
  and there.
  
* Transcoding from FLV (Flash video) is known to be problematic due to issues 
  with the GStreamer FFMpeg plugins. This is likely to be solved in the next
  release of the GStreamer "bad" plugins. See OggConvert bug #155023 for details.
