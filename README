OggConvert 0.3.1
----------------

This is the latest release of OggConvert, a simple Gnome utility to convert
media files into the patent-free Theora, Dirac and Vorbis formats.

Dirac encoding requires GStreamer 0.10.11 and the Schroedinger encoder. Be aware
that the encoder is still experimental, and that videos you encode today might
not be watchable in future as the decoder develops.

OggConvert is written in Python using PyGTK and PyGST. It is released under the 
GNU LGPL.


What's new in this version:
---------------------------

* Support for altering the quality of Dirac output if using a recent enough
  version of the Schroedinger encoder (>0.9). Thanks to Schroedinger author
  David Schleef for this.
  
* In light of better support for Flash video in new versions of GStreamer
  plugins, make .flv files show up in the file selector.
  
* Fix an embarrassing bug in the last version which caused filenames to be 
  escaped when they shouldn't have been.

* Check for the presence of the Matroska muxer at startup, removing an
  unintentional dependency on the GStreamer "good" plugins.

* New translations: Czech, Finnish, Malay, Occitan, Portugese, Simplified
  Chinese, Ukranian. Many thanks to all the translators. To add your language, 
  please go to http://translations.launchpad.net/oggconvert.

* Other minor bug fixes


Known issues with this release:
-------------------------------

* Gnome-VFS support hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. There may be bugs here
  and there.
  
* Transcoding from FLV (Flash video) is known to be problematic due to issues 
  with the GStreamer FFMpeg plugins. This is likely to be solved in the next
  release of the GStreamer "bad" plugins. See OggConvert bug #155023 for details.
