OggConvert 0.2.0
----------------

This is the second release of OggConvert, a simple Gnome utility to convert
media files into the patent-free Theora, Dirac and Vorbis formats.

Dirac encoding requires GStreamer 0.10.11 and the Schroedinger encoder. Be aware
that the encoder is still experimental, and that videos you encode today might
not be watchable in future as the decoder develops.

OggConvert is written in Python using PyGTK and PyGST. It is released under the 
GNU LGPL.


What's new in this version:
---------------------------

* Support for Dirac. Wooo!
 
* OggConvert now actually quits when you close it with the window manager
  (although nobody actually complained about that in the last version)
  
* OggConvert no longer crashes horribly with pitfdll (although it still can't
  use it for encoding)
  
* We now check whether the encoder has stalled, and warn the user. This helps 
  with the common case of the end-of-stream message not being fired correctly, 
  and the process being stuck on 99.5% or so.
  
* A lovely new "about" dialogue!

* Many other small bugfixes



Known issues with this release:
-------------------------------

* The video quality setting doesn't do anything for Dirac encoding, due to the
  encoder not (yet) having this option available.

* With GStreamer 0.10.10 (the version used in Ubuntu Edgy), transcoding from
  certain containers (Matroka and ASF in particular) will result in very choppy
  audio. This is fixed for GStreamer 0.10.11 (included in Feisty).
  
* OggConvert uses the GStreamer decodebin, so it *should* be able to convert any
  file which is playable in Totem. However, there is currently a problem with
  files which use the pitfdll/W32codecs package, whereby the pipeline doesn't
  preroll. I'm still investigating why this happens, but at least OggConvert
  doesn't crash any more ;)
  
* OggConvert should Just Work(tm) with the Fluendo codec packages. However, I 
  don't own a copy of these plugins, so I haven't tested it.
