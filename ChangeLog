0.2.0:
------

* Support for Dirac. Wooo!
 
* OggConvert now actually quits when you close it with the window manager
  (although nobody actually complained about that in the last version)
  
* OggConvert no longer crashes horribly with pitfdll (although it still can't
  use it for encoding)
  
* We now check whether the encoder has stalled, and warn the user. This helps 
  with the common case of the end-of-stream message not being fired correctly, 
  and the process being stuck on 99.5% or so.
  
* A lovely new "about" dialogue!

* Many other small bugfixes
 

0.1.0:
------

* First release. Get testing!
