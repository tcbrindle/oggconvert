0.3.3:
------

* Add support for the newly-opened VP8 codec.

* Add support for the WebM version of Matroska, but only use .webm as an the
  extension if this is used in combination with the VP8 encoder.
  
* Fix Dirac encoder detection not working since schroenc moved to 
  gst-plugins-bad. Fixes LP: #573603

0.3.2:
------

* Use time() rather than clock() for working out elapsed encoding time, 
  which should sort out time remaining being way off on AMD64. Hopefully 
  closes bug #250174.
  
* Add a version check on the Schroedinger encoder at startup, we require 
  1.0.0 or newer. This means we can...
  
* Remove the warning about Dirac encoding being experimental, since it's 
  not any more.
  
* The quality sliders now go down to zero. As a side-effect, this  means 
  that OggConvert's quality settings should correspond to those of 
  ffmpeg2theora (for video, at least).
  
* Use "perceptual weighting" by default in the Dirac encoder, as 
  recommended by the Schro author. This results in dramatically smaller 
  output files at the same noise threshold (and slightly faster encoding 
  times), at the expense of a slight loss of picture quality. I think 
  it's worth it.

* Added new translations: ca, frp, he, hu, lt, mt, nb, sk, sr, tr, zh_TW, plus
  other translations updated. Many thanks to all the translators.


0.3.1:
------

* Added Schro quality setting (thanks to David Schleef). Closes #180228

* Use urllib to unescape the URIs that gtk.FileChooser gives us. Closes 
  #182607

* As new versions of gst-plugins-base and gst-ffmpeg (take your pic) 
  offer reasonable support for the FLV container, add 
  "application/x-flash-video" as a special case under Video and All Files 
  in the file selector. Closes #155023

* Remove a minor type error that sometimes occured when a file had completed.

* Don't actually init anything in __init__.py, because apparently that 
  breaks stuff (!). Added a new file ocv_init.py instead. Closes #175770

* Check for Matroska support at startup to remove an unintended dependency
  on gstreamer-plugins-good.

* Removed another incorrect '#!' that snuck back in because I'm an idiot

* Added new translations: cs, fi, ms, oc, pt, uk, zh_CN, plus other translations
  updated. Many thanks to all the translators.

0.3.0:
------

* Added support for muxing to the Matroska, thanks to Carlos Perelló Marín.

* Added translation support, thanks to Alex Kabakov.

* Added A. Bram Neijt's OggConvert icon.

* Added support for using Gnome-VFS sources (actually, the encoder can now use 
  any URI scheme that GStreamer understands, which is more than just Gnome-VFS,
  but there's no GUI support fro this yet).
  
* Rewritten, faster, better, callback-based, non-blocking media checking routine.

* Communication between the encoder and the GUI is now done the "proper" way. 

* New translations: bg, de, es, fr, it, ko, nl, pl, pr_BR, ru, sv. Thanks to
  all the translators.
  
* Bugs fixed in this version: #117849 (Include an icon for OggConvert)
                              #120889 (Add Matroska support)
                              #129069 (Current icon is ugly) (!)
                              #133022 (Selected directory doesn't reflect output)
                              #160054 (Ogg video files should use .ogv extension)


0.2.1:
------

* Minor release to make life easier for packagers

* Removed incorrect #! invocations from source files

* Included a basic manpage. Thanks to Luca Falivigna for this.

* oggconvert.desktop now conforms to freedesktop.org standards

* Oh, okay, one proper bugfix: #119586 (Convert dialog is not resizable)


0.2.0:
------

* Support for Dirac. Wooo!
 
* OggConvert now actually quits when you close it with the window manager
  (although nobody actually complained about that in the last version)
  
* OggConvert no longer crashes horribly with pitfdll (although it still can't
  use it for encoding)
  
* We now check whether the encoder has stalled, and warn the user. This helps 
  with the common case of the end-of-stream message not being fired correctly, 
  and the process being stuck on 99.5% or so.
  
* A lovely new "about" dialogue!

* Many other small bugfixes
 

0.1.0:
------

* First release. Get testing!
