0.3.0:
------

* Added support for muxing to the Matroska, thanks to Carlos Perelló Marín.

* Added translation support, thanks to Alex Kabakov.

* Added A. Bram Neijt's OggConvert icon.

* Added support for using Gnome-VFS sources (actually, the encoder can now use 
  any URI scheme that GStreamer understands, which is more than just Gnome-VFS,
  but there's no GUI support fro this yet).
  
* Rewritten, faster, better, callback-based, non-blocking media checking routine.

* Communication between the encoder and the GUI is now done the "proper" way. 

* New translations: bg, de, es, fr, it, ko, nl, pl, pr_BR, ru, sv. Thanks to
  all the translators.
  
* Bugs fixed in this version: #117849 (Include an icon for OggConvert)
                              #120889 (Add Matroska support)
                              #129069 (Current icon is ugly) (!)
                              #133022 (Selected directory doesn't reflect output)
                              #160054 (Ogg video files should use .ogv extension)


0.2.1:
------

* Minor release to make life easier for packagers

* Removed incorrect #! invocations from source files

* Included a basic manpage. Thanks to Luca Falivigna for this.

* oggconvert.desktop now conforms to freedesktop.org standards

* Oh, okay, one proper bugfix: #119586 (Convert dialog is not resizable)


0.2.0:
------

* Support for Dirac. Wooo!
 
* OggConvert now actually quits when you close it with the window manager
  (although nobody actually complained about that in the last version)
  
* OggConvert no longer crashes horribly with pitfdll (although it still can't
  use it for encoding)
  
* We now check whether the encoder has stalled, and warn the user. This helps 
  with the common case of the end-of-stream message not being fired correctly, 
  and the process being stuck on 99.5% or so.
  
* A lovely new "about" dialogue!

* Many other small bugfixes
 

0.1.0:
------

* First release. Get testing!
